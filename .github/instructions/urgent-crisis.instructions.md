# Urgent/Crisis Communication Email Writing Guidelines

When writing urgent or crisis communication emails, follow these guidelines to ensure clarity and prompt action:

## Core Principles
- **Lead with urgency level**: Immediately communicate the severity
- **Be crystal clear**: No ambiguity about the situation or required actions
- **Provide context quickly**: Essential background in 1-2 sentences
- **Focus on solutions**: What's being done and what help is needed

## Language Guidelines
- Use direct, action-oriented language
- Include urgency indicators in subject and body
- Be specific about timelines and deadlines
- Use imperative voice for action items
- Avoid unnecessary pleasantries (skip "hope you're well")

## Structure Requirements
1. **Subject line**: [URGENT], [ACTION REQUIRED], or [CRITICAL] prefix
2. **Opening**: State the issue immediately
3. **Impact**: Brief explanation of consequences
4. **Status**: What's already been done
5. **Action needed**: Specific requests with deadlines
6. **Contact info**: Multiple ways to reach you immediately

## Urgency Levels
- **Critical**: System down, security breach, safety issue
- **High**: Major client issue, missed deadline, significant bug
- **Medium**: Important decision needed, resource constraint
- **Low**: FYI item that affects planning

## Essential Elements
- **Timeline**: When did this happen/when is deadline
- **Impact**: Who/what is affected
- **Current status**: What's being done now
- **Next steps**: Specific actions and owners
- **Escalation path**: Who to contact if no response

## Language Examples
- "IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:"
- "Issue discovered at [time]"
- "Client is expecting resolution by [deadline]"
- "Need your approval within 2 hours"
- "Please respond ASAP to confirm receipt"
- "Escalating to [person] if no response by [time]"

## Follow-up Requirements
- Send status updates every [X] hours during crisis
- Confirm receipt of urgent emails
- Provide post-resolution summary
- Document lessons learned
