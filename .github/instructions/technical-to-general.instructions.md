# Technical to General Audience Email Writing Guidelines

When writing emails that translate technical concepts for general audiences, follow these guidelines:

## Core Principles
- **Simplify without condescending**: Use plain language while respecting the reader's intelligence
- **Use analogies**: Relate complex technical concepts to everyday experiences
- **Avoid jargon**: Replace technical terms with common words or explain them clearly
- **Focus on benefits**: Emphasize what the technology does for the user, not how it works

## Language Guidelines
- Replace technical terms with simple alternatives:
  - "API" → "connection between systems"
  - "Database" → "digital filing system"
  - "Server" → "computer that stores information"
  - "Bandwidth" → "internet speed"
  - "Bug" → "problem" or "issue"

## Structure Requirements
1. **Subject line**: Clear, benefit-focused, no technical acronyms
2. **Opening**: State the purpose in one simple sentence
3. **Body**: Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
4. **Action items**: Use bullet points for clarity
5. **Closing**: Offer help and next steps

## Tone Guidelines
- Friendly and approachable
- Confident but not arrogant
- Patient and helpful
- Avoid technical superiority

## Examples of Good Transitions
- Instead of: "The API integration failed due to authentication errors"
- Write: "The connection between our systems had a login problem that we've now fixed"

## Testing Your Email
Before sending, ask yourself:
- Would my non-technical family member understand this?
- Have I explained the benefit, not just the feature?
- Are there any acronyms or jargon I missed?
- Is the action I want them to take crystal clear?
