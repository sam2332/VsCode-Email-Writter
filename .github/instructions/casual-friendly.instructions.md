# Casual Friendly Email Writing Guidelines

When writing casual, friendly emails, follow these guidelines to maintain warmth while staying professional:

## Core Principles
- **Be warm and approachable**: Use friendly, conversational tone
- **Show personality**: Let your authentic voice come through
- **Build relationships**: Focus on connection, not just business
- **Keep it natural**: Write as you would speak in a friendly conversation

## Language Guidelines
- Use conversational language and contractions
- Include personal touches when appropriate
- Use friendly expressions:
  - "Hope you're doing well!"
  - "Thanks so much for..."
  - "I'd love to hear your thoughts"
  - "Looking forward to catching up"
  - "Hope this helps!"

## Structure Requirements
1. **Subject line**: Friendly but clear, can use emojis sparingly
2. **Greeting**: "Hi [First Name]!" or "Hey [Name]!"
3. **Opening**: Warm personal touch or reference
4. **Body**: Conversational flow, shorter paragraphs
5. **Action items**: Casual but clear requests
6. **Closing**: Warm sign-off like "Cheers," "Talk soon," "Best"

## Tone Guidelines
- Enthusiastic and positive
- Genuine and authentic
- Supportive and encouraging
- Relaxed but still respectful

## Appropriate Contexts
- Team communications
- Internal project updates
- Client relationships after rapport is established
- Vendor communications
- Networking follow-ups
- Thank you messages

## Friendly Language Examples
- "Hope your week's going great!"
- "Just wanted to touch base about..."
- "Thanks a bunch for..."
- "Would love to get your take on this"
- "Let me know what you think!"
- "Excited to see how this turns out"

## Balance Guidelines
- Maintain professionalism while being friendly
- Match the tone of previous communications
- Consider company culture and recipient preferences
- Avoid being too casual with senior executives (unless established)
